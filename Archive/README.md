Scripts and intermediary files available under each folder, except when data files were too heavy (such as the full set of GC network edges).

This is a somewhat curated subset of the most relevant scripts and intermediary files. The original collection - containing 30k+ files (over 6 GB) since this project started in 2015 - is saved on a personal Dropbox folder and the Cornell University BioHPC. 

We are in the process of cleaning up, annotating, and integrating all the scripts for easier accessiblity and reproducibility. In the meantime, please reach out to <mfs97@cornell.edu> with any questions or requests.
